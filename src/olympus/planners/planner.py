# NOTE: This goes against the python convention of having function names being
# lowercase, but I thought Planner still works in this case as it effectively
# returns a class instance
# A function seems to me the easiest way to do this right now, but another
# option would be to have a class and fiddle with __new__ an return an instance
# of a different class. I would stick with the simplest option that achieve
# what we need though, unless we already foresee possible expansions that need a
# more complex object

    """Convenience function to access planners via a slightly higher level interface It returns a certain planner
    with defaults arguments by keyword.

    Args:
        kind (str or AbstractPlanner): Keyword identifying one of the algorithms available in Olympus. Alternatively,
            you can pass a custom algorithm that is a subclass of AbstractPlanner.
        goal (bool): The optimization goal, either 'minimize' or 'maximize'. Default is 'minimize'.
        param_space (ParamSpace): A ParameterSpace object defining the space over which to search.

    Returns:
        Planner: An instance of the chosen planning algorithm.
